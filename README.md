# C# Basics

## Code
This contains various examples of fundamentals used within the C# language. Different sections are broken up by a block of comments starting with:

### Setup:
I created this in Visual Studio Code using .NET 5.0.301

#### Description:
I made this program to learn the fundamentals of C#, it covers the following topics:

Hello World, Variables, Data Types, Strings, Numbers, User Input(s), simple addition calculator, mad lib string example, arrays, methods (functions), return statements, if statements, calculator w/ user chosen operation, switch statements, while loops, guessing game, for loops, exponent function, 2d arrays and nested loops, exception handling, classes & objects, constructor functions, object methods, getters & setters, static class attributes, static methods and classes, and inheritance

## Program.cs:
This is the main file that this program uses. Stand-alone methods are below the "main" method while external classes and methods are located in the other .cs files within the "hello_world" directory. This program runs in one shot with ReadLine() breaks between most sections, requiring the user to hit the "enter" key to progress. Most of the sections with input are not validated (aside from the "exception handling" section) as this was for learning purposes and not intended for external use.
